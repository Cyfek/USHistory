  <p>Klaus Fuchs was a German-British Physisct who worked as part of the <a href="manhatten.htm">Manhatten project<a>. He was a Soviet spy, who gave nuclear seacrets to the USSR. He was just one of a number of spies in the project. Most spies did that ecause they were communists, but some did it because they were worried of the consequences of a world where only one nation had the power to distroy eyeryone. He was uncovered and sentanced to 14 years in prison in 1950.<p>

	<p>Due in part to the actions of such spies as Fuchs, the USSR was able to test its first atomic weapon, РДС-1, in August 1949. Althoguh they attempted to keep it a seacret, American airplanes which had been equiped with radiation sensors picked up on the fallout and were able to trace it back to the source. The intelegence that a succsesful test had been completed was supprising to the Western bowers, as they had not expected the Soviets to have such a weapon until 1953 at the eailest. <p>
