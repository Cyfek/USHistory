	<H3><a id="Fuchs">Klaus Fuchs</a></H3><hr>
  <p>Klaus Fuchs was a German-British Physicist who worked as part of the <a href="manhatten.htm">Manhattan project<a>. He was a Soviet spy, who gave nuclear secrets to the USSR. He was just one of a number of spies in the project. Most spies did that because they were communists, but some did it because they were worried of the consequences of a world where only one nation had the power to destroy everyone. He was uncovered and sentenced to 14 years in prison in 1950.<p>

	<p>Due in part to the actions of such spies as Fuchs, the USSR was able to test its first atomic weapon, РДС-1, in August 1949. Although they attempted to keep it a secret, American airplanes which had been equipped with radiation sensors picked up on the fallout and were able to trace it back to the source. The intelligence that a successful test had been completed was surprising to the Western bowers, as they had not expected the Soviets to have such a weapon until 1953 at the earliest. <p>

	<H3><a id="MAD">Mutual Assured Destruction</a></H3><hr>
  <p>After both superpowers assumed the ability to destroy the other almost completely with only a few bombs, they both immediately set to work making sure the other side couldn't launch a preemptive strike which would destroy their nuclear capability before they could respond with a strike of their own. This was accomplished through a number of means: nuclear-armed airplanes, continually flying; well defended missile silos; Nuclear submarines with weapons that could sting any place from anywhere; and even nuclear-missile-armed motile trains. After this time, a sort of nuclear stalemate set in, deemed "Mutual Assured Destruction". The idea was that any attack by one party would result in an immediate counterattack by the other, and the destruction of both. As such, the conflict between the US and the USSR became a "Cold War", in which neither power would attack the other directly. Instead, they fought various proxy wars along the edges of their spheres of influence.<p>

	  <H3><a id="cuba">Cuban Missile Crisis</a></H3><hr>
	  <p>The Cuban Missile Crisis was an event that occurred during the 13 days between 16th and 28th of October, 1962. At the beginning of that time, the USSR sent nuclear missiles to their ally Cuba, to be used against the US in case of a war. Although the operation was supposed to be secret, US spy planes were able to photograph the launch sites being constructed. This led to much higher tensions between the two superpowers. Eventually, President Kennady was able to secretly get the USSR to remove the missiles in excrace for a US removal of similar missiles in Turkey and Greece.
