  <p>Fission was discovered in 1938 by the German physicist Otto Hahn, and the theory behind it was worked out by Lise Meitner the next year. However, it would take 6 more years before it could be harnessed for use in a bomb.</p>

  <p>A-Bombs work by causing a nuclear fission chain reaction. In the center of every atom, there is an object called a nucleus, which is composed of two types of particles: protons, and neutrons. In some cases, if the number of protons and neutrons is not correctly balanced, the nucleus may become unstable. If an atom in this situation is hit by a stray neutron, it can split, releasing energy and a few more neutrons. If enough such atoms are forced together in one place, these neutrons can split further atoms, leading to a chain reaction and a large amount of energyâ€” an explosion. The following are the two main ways such atoms can be brought together as such, inside of an Atomic Bomb:</p>

  <p>An H-Bomb, or "Thermonuclear Bomb" is a more powerful atomic weapon, based on fusion, instead of fission. It has two parts: A <i>Primary</i>, which is itself an A-bomb, and a <i>Secondary</i>, which contains light elements (that is, elements with small nuclei). When the Primary explodes, it produces a huge amount of energy and pressure, which causes some of the light nuclei in the Secondary to fuse together, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. <p>
