	<H1> Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki </H1>
	<p><i> The first, and currently only, use of Nuclear Weapons in war.</i></p>
	<br><br>
	
	<H3>US Motivation</H3><Hr>
	<p>The main motivation for President Truman to use Atomic force in Japan was to stave off a direct invasion of the Home Islands of Japan. Other battles had been extremely deadly and hard fought, and the US high command had reason to believe that an invasion would be even more opposed, with casualties possibly topping one million.</p>
	<p>Some officials in the US command wanted to make a public demonstration of the power of the Bomb before making an actual atack, but this idea was rejected, as there was a possibility of it failing, being a waste of one of the few bombs the US had, or even a cause for the Japanese government to move POWs into city centers as hostages.</p>

	<H3>Hiroshima</a></H3><hr>
  	<p>The original top target for the A-Bomb was a city called Kokura. However, due to cloudy weather, Hiroshima was decided on instead. All the cities on the list of targets had purposely not been bombed already, to better show the Atomic Bomb's power. The nickname of the weapon used was <i>Little Boy</i> and the bomber was a B-29 named <i>Enola Gay</i>. The bomb was dropped at 8:15 Japan time on August 6th. The target was the T-shaped Aioi bridge in the center of the images below, which show the city before and after the destruction from the Bomb and the fires it set off.<p>

	<p>Survivors, or <i>Hibakusha</i>, discribed the bomb as a <i>"Pika-Don"</i>, where <i>Pika</i> (sparkle) refers to the blinding flash of light, and <i>Don</i> (Booom) means the shockwave and rush of air from the explosion.<p>

	<p>Despite being very close to the epicenter, this building, the so-called <i>"Genbaku Dome"</i> remained mostly intact. It now stands as the centerpiece of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial.</p>

	<H3>Nagasaki</H3><hr>
  	<p>Despite the terrible distruction caused by the bombing of Hiroshima, the Japanese high command did not accept the American's offer of unconditional surrender. As such, another Atomic Bomb, called <i>Fat Man</i> was dropped three days later on the port city of Nagasaki.<p> 
	<p>Although the yield of <i>Fat Man</i> was greater than that of <i>Little Boy</i>, the differing geography between Hirsoshima and Nagasaki caused it to do less damage. However, it was still devastating.<p><br>
	
	<p>Neverless, the combination of the two atomic bombings with the Soviet rumor of declaration of way compelled the Japanese high command to finally surrender on the 12th. The Emperor of Japan gave an unprecedented speech, known as the "Jewel Voice Broadcast" directly to the Japanese people, in which he indirectly referred to the atomic bombs as "A new and most cruel bomb", citing it as one of the reasons the war was ended.</p>
