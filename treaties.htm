	<H3><a id="Szilárd_Letter">The Enstein-Szilárd Letter</a></H3><hr>
  <p>This is an image of a letter that was sent in August 1939 to FDR. It was written by a German-Hungarian atomic physicist named Leo Szilárd, who was one of the first to realize the possibility that atomic fission could be used to create bombs of unprecedented power. Szilárd was worried about the possibility that Germany or another county would be able to produce such weapons before the United States did, so he urged FDR to fund research on the subject. Because Szilárd wasn't well known, he asked Albert Einstein, a friend of his, to sign it instead.<p>

	<p>Roosevet acted on the letter, setting up the Advisory Committee on Uranium, which was succeeded by a number of other groups. However, work on the creation of an atomic weapon did not start in earnest until the Manhattan Project, which started two years later in June 1942.<p>

  <p>The Manhattan project consisted of three main centers: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which produced Uranium; Hanford, Washington, which housed Plutonium-forming nuclear reactors, and Los Alamos, where most of the Research and Development on the bomb was done. This mainly involved engineering work, as the base science had already been worked out.<p>

		<p><i>Trinity</i> was the name of the first nuclear weapon test. It took place on July 16th, 1945 in the White Sands Missile Range. The weapon was nicknamed <i>Gadget</i>.<p>

		<p>After the test, Robert Oppenheimer (the scientist in charge of the Manhattan Project) famously said "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.", quoting an ancient Hindu scripture.</p>
