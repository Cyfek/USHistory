  <p>This is an image of a letter that was sent in August 1939 to FDR. It was written by a German atomic physicist named Leo Szilárd, who was one of the first to realize the posibily that atomic fission could be used to create bombs of unprecedented power. Szilárd was woried about the posibilty that Germany or another county would be able to produce such weapons before the United States did, so he urged FDR to fund reasearch on the subject. Because Szilárd wasn't well known, he asked Albert Einstein, a friend of his, to sign it instead.<p>

	<p>Roosevet acted on the letter, setting up the Advisory Commity on Uranium. However, work on the creation of an atomic weapon did not start in ernest until the Manhatten Project, which started two years later in June 1942.<p>
